# Team Agreement (Andy Agulue, Ceylin Brooks, Fizzo Pannosch, James Mansour)

### Conflict plan: 
- What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it? We plan to solve any conflicts with group mediation while also being very open and honest about how we are feeling and what caused that upset. 
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? We will communicate with each other in a respectful manner.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? In the unlikely event that we are unable to work together as a team we will ask for help from Nicholas.

### Communication Plan:
- How will your group communicate with each other? We plan to use Slack, remo and Trello!
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?  We plan to have a time at the beginning of our meetings in Remo to check in. During this time, we will voice any concerns. Being intentional to check with everyone and make sure we all have a place to speak.
- Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety? Asking how everyone is doing during our meetings everyday. We also plan to ask for everyone’s input on the project and evenly disperse the work. As well as taking breaks as needed!
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? Slack will be our primary form of communication after hours and on the weekends. We will make sure every team member has Slack downloaded on their phone and notifications setup. And no requirement for responses after 6pm.

### Work plan: 
- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?  We will try our best to evenly disperse the work and utilize Trello to lay out the tasks that need to be done.
- In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems? We plan on performing a standup each morning to check in and ensure everyone has adequate work and tasks assigned as well as ensure we all know what each other are working on and can offer assistance to one another when possible. We plan to do group pushes and pair programming as well as working individually. We plan to potentially work at the same remo table all day but for the minimum we also plan to meet in the evening as well as the morning of everyday. 
- What project management tool will be used? Trello!

### Git process: 
- What components of your project will live on GitHub? Our Project Repository. 
- What is your Git flow? We plan to push all our work at the beginning of our meetings and have two members of the group have to approve the pushes. We then plan to do a git pull at the end of the end of all meetings. In addition we will require 2 people to approve each pull request and allow pull requests throughout the day.
- How many people must review a PR? Two people!
- Who merges PRs? Anyone after the PR has been approved.
- How often will you merge? As often as we need to in regards to the project!
- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? We will reach out to each other over slack as well as hangout at the same remo table so we are aware of what’s on.
